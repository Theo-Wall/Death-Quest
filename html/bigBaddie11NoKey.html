      You walk through the castle, you know what you must do, you walk straight to the stairs. As you walk up the
      stairs an insidious feeling is building in your chest. You can't do this. You're not ready. You aren't strong enough,
      You aren't wise enough, You aren't brave enough. You reach the tower door in front of you and see a golden key hole,
      "WHY DIDN"T YOU GET THE KEY" you think to yourself, but you go forward. As you press your hand on the door to enter a
      stream of intense self loathing flows into you. "YOU CAN'T DO IT", "YOU'LL NEVER BE GOOD ENOUGH". To your left the tower
      window looks so inviting, you dive out the window. You fall for a long time before you smash on the rocks
      below.
