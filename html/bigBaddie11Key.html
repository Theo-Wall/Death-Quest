        You walk through the castle, you know what you must do, you walk straight to the stairs. Suddenly it's all
        coming back to you the countless times you've done this before and every time failure. You are nearing the top of the
        tower. You can feel the countless deaths before you and after you. But, you know what must be done. You reach the door
        and pull out the key and begin to put the key into the lock. """NNNOOOO""" You hear a thousand of your voices yelling.
        You take the key and throw it out the window and kick the tower door in and see on the other side..........
