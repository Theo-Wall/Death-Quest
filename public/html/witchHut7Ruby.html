        You see a small hut in the distance, as you walk up to the door a strong scent of 
        sulphur hits your nose, you wretch but continue on. Right as you get to the door it slowly swings open and you enter.
        Inside you see a witch stirring a large caldron, she says to you "My my my what a tastey specimen, what are you doing in
        my humble abode?". Your legs begin to walk over to her, you are unable to stop yourself. "Aaaaah whats this I'm smelling
        now? I think you have something of <span id="ruby">mine</span> that the filthy necromancer stole from me, give it here young lad":
